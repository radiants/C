% % this is just a simple example for  estimating NaCl-KCl-H2O system at 35 ℃

% % systemnakcl.mat is the solubility database for traing and the solubility at 35 ℃ are not involved in.

% % core_code_for_estimiting.m is used for GRNN modeling and estimating.

% % GrawGriewank.m is the function for drawing Griewank function.
% % Griewank.m is the innerfunction.

% % StandardTestbySA_GRNN is the Prediction results for training set samples. 
% % (“True” are values computed by Griewank benchmark function, “SA-GRNN” are values estimated by SA-GRNN model, “GRNN” are values estimated by GRNN.)
